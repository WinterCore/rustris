<h4 align="center">Simple Tetris game written in <s>Rust</s> C</h4>

This project was supposed to be written in Rust but I changed my mind because apparently OpenGL is full of unsafe code and there's no advantage in using Rust so I'll be writing it in C, and NO I will not change the name.


### TODO

- Don't use any terms from the real Tetris game, and make it undiscoverable
